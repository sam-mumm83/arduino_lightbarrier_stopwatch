# arduino_lightbarrier_stopwatch
Arduino project with a IR lightbarrier that triggers a counter and displays "laptimes" on a 32x16-led-dot-matrix-display
The plan is to add another lightbarrier in the future, so I don't need to get back to the start.

This is just a small project that I finally got working (enough) for my purpose. A Arduino UNO R3 in a housing, 2 status leds (power and "light barrier crossed") and a remote sensor connected via 3 cables (+, - and data). One 32x16-led-dot-matrix-display (a great thing from freetronics.org) is connected via a 16-pin-flat-cable to display the lap-time and lightbarrier-status.
I started this because my kids loved playing with a small installation in a park that was measuring their speed and "lap-times" with 2 light barriers. A good way to make your kids go out and get active ;-)

It turned out that this works great for racing laps with our RC cars and get their lap times...

In this repository, I keep the code, but no detailed project description.
